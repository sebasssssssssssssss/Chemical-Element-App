# Chemical-Element-App

A simple PyQt5-based GUI application for retrieving information about elements from the periodic table. This app reads data from a JSON 
file and displays element properties based on user input

## Credits
This project uses element data sourced from the [Periodic Table API](https://github.com/thetechnohack/Periodic-Table-API), which is 
licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/thetechnohack/Periodic-Table-API/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Features
- Search for elements by their chemical symbol
- Display various properties of elements like atomic mass, electronegativity, density, etc
- User-friendly graphical interface

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyQt5 library

## Purpose
This is my first small project, and I want to come back in the future to track my progress over the years. It uses basic functionality of the PyQt5 library in python 

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chemical-element-app.git
   cd chemical-element-app
